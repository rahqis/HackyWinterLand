## Inspiration

#In this holiday season, when the weather outside is cold and chilly, there is always someone in need of a helping hand. Our team wanted to give these "helping hands" a easy and efficient way to find charities of all types near them to donate.

## What it does

#This app gathers the category of charity(i.e. Animals, Health, Education, etc.) a person wants to donate in and their zipcode and gives them a list of charities in that category near them in which they wish to donate.

## How we built it

###We built this app using react.js

## Challenges we ran into

#The challenges we ran into while making this app was figuring out how to navigate between buttons and webpage. It took ages for us to figure it out

#Another set of issues we ran into was converting the data we got from an API into a JSON file. It was converted into everything expect what we needed it to be

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

#We are proud to build an interactive website having known little to nothing about react going into the hackathon. We are also proud of overcoming multiple challenges, however small it may be to others

## What we learned

#While building the app, we got to learn and be familiar with some of the basic operations that can be done in react, like navigating between pages and displaying options. We also learned how to fetch data from an API and how to display it in react

## What's next for Gravity for Charity

#We plan to make our app fully fledged and user friendly by working out a few kinks and implementing even more components to our app. Most importantly, we plan on deploying our application for the world to see on the Internet!
